A Webhook allows an internet server, like our Sendgrid (our e-mail delivery service), to make requests to our localhost server. 

It will be used to sinalize our services that someone, that have received our survey, have clicked on YES or NO button, answering our survey. 

You won't have this kind of problem when running the application from the production environment. 

To do that we will use localtunnel

	> https://localtunnel.github.io/www

The architecture will work like this:
	
	[PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT]
	> Sendgrid will call, every 30 seconds, a service deployed at our service. 

	[DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT - using webhook/localtunnel]
	> Sendgrid will call, every 30 seconds, a service available at webhookhelper.localtunnel.com.

	> webhookhelper.localtunnel.com will be configured to connect to our Localtunnel Server on our computer

	> The Localtunnel Server on our computer will call our service deployed at localhost:5000

Installing 

	From the root server path:

		$ npm install --save localtunnel

Configuring

	On the package.json, at the server root path, on the "script" section

	Configuring local tunnel at our Local Server

		Just add a new like as below:

		"scripts" : {
			... ,
			"webhook": "lt -p 5000 -s rsmoreira-webhook-localtunnel"
		}

	Running the localtunnel every time our server is started

		Still, on the scripts section, update the "dev" command as following:
		(\"npm run webhook\")
		
		"scripts" : {
			... ,
			"dev": "concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\" \"npm run webhook\"",
			...
		}
